# noteAI

noteAI is a Python-based desktop application that enables you to extract text from images using OCR and generate study notes in a question-answer format from PDF files. The application leverages experimental Google Gemini models for both image-to-text and note generation, and it features a clean and intuitive PyQt5 GUI.

## Features

- **Image Text Extraction:**  
  Uses OCR and image captioning to extract text from images ([`app/image2text.py`](app/image2text.py)).

- **Study Note Generation:**  
  Processes PDF files to generate study notes in a Q&A format ([`app/note.py`](app/note.py)).

- **Graphical User Interface:**  
  A user-friendly PyQt5 interface for uploading files and processing ([`app/gui.py`](app/gui.py)).

- **[`app/main.py`](app/main.py):**  
  Entry point for the application that initializes the PyQt5 app, sets the window icon, and launches the GUI.

- **[`app/gui.py`](app/gui.py):**  
  Implements the main GUI for file uploads and processing.

- **[`app/image2text.py`](app/image2text.py):**  
  Contains the logic to extract text from images using Google Gemini's experimental OCR and image captioning capabilities.

- **[`app/note.py`](app/note.py):**  
  Implements the note generation logic from PDF files including the Q&A format.

- **[`app/logic.py`](app/logic.py):**  
  Orchestrates the workflow by integrating image-to-text and note generation processes.

- **[`app/styles.py`](app/styles.py):**  
  Contains the stylesheet definitions for the GUI.

- **[`app/.env`](app/.env):**  
  Stores environment variables such as the Google API key.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd noteAI
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   # On Unix/macOS:
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Dependencies include PyQt5, python-dotenv, Pillow, and Google GenAI client libraries.*

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Edit .env to include your Google API key:
   
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**

   Start the application by running:

   ```sh
   python app/main.py
   ```

2. **Upload Files via GUI:**

   - Click "ðŸ“„ Upload PDF" to select a PDF file.
   - Click "ðŸ–¼ Upload Image" to select an image file.
   - Once both files are uploaded, click "â–¶ Start Process" to extract text from the image and generate study notes from the PDF.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that the app-icon.png exists for the window icon.
- Check that your API key in .env is valid and has necessary permissions.
